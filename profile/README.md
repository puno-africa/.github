Puno Exists to drive small scale farmers into commercialization because the future of the African economy, a sustainable future that is, lies in exporting less, distributing our food resources better(throwing away less food).

    It is good practice to "Create Issues" on the Repository if you want to keep track of the Tasks and User Stories; as well as assigning them to designated Developers in the Team.

    ALWAYS Create a Branch of your own. Only Merge into the Main branch when the whole team is about to make a release of the project.

    NEVER work on the same branch as this makes it very hard to collaborate, especially if team members have been assigned with different tasks. Therefore, ONLY work on the same branch if you are all working on the same task 
</li>

<li>
  ALWAYS Make a Pull Request to let others know that you've completed a task and have Commited & Pushed the updates thereof, into your branch. This will allow them to review your changes and merge these into their branches.
